<h2 style="color: #a23333; text-decoration: none; margin-top:0; text-shadow: 1px 1px #000;">Update:</h2>
All of my services have succesfully been migrated to <a href="https://1984hosting.com">1984hosting</a>'s infrastructure in Iceland, no issues of significance were had and the only downtime experienced was the expected time it takes for DNS records to update and propagate throughout the internet. After a couple days of fairly heavy usage I'm quite content with performance for the tests I have performed, I'd still like to test the I/O a little further with heavier databases but I don't think it'll be much of a problem.
