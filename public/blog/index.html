<h3><a href="/blog/how-manage-this-website/">How I manage this website</a></h3>
<p class="desc">Run-down of the process and tools I use to keep efym.net running.
August 25, 2022
Update: I no longer edit and deploy this website using this script, the post will remain around for archiving purposes.
efym.net is currently built using Hugo. Static site generation Back when I was around 10 years old one of my older cousins showed me how to make very simple web pages by writing the html tags directly into a file with notepad.</p>

<h3><a href="/blog/appalling-anysoftkeyboard-feature/">Appalling Anysoftkeyboard Feature</a></h3>
<p class="desc">When developers turn their software into a propaganda tool.
First off let me clarify that the word &ldquo;feature&rdquo; in this post&rsquo;s title is being used extremely sarcastically; I&rsquo;m not one to stress much about mobile phones, I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of them and use them very sparingly but I still own one. It runs LineageOS and every single application installed on it was downloaded from F-Droid, so no proprietary software at all in userland.</p>

<h3><a href="/blog/why-i-self-host/">Why I self-host everything I can</a></h3>
<p class="desc">Thoughts on why I host the services I use.
Opening remarks Everyone who knows me or has interacted with me in a meaningful way is aware of my disdain towards major corporations, especially the ones that focus in technology. Most of the reasons for this are more ethical and philosophical in nature than born out of practicality, convenience or economic/monetary incentives.
This is to say I don&rsquo;t disagree they&rsquo;re exceptionally good at what they do or produce, however I think what they do and produce is detrimental to human liberty and society as a whole too, in most cases.</p>

<h3><a href="/blog/voidlinux-install/">Voidlinux Install</a></h3>
<p class="desc">Notes on my Void Linux setup.
Recently I switched the linux distribution I use on my desktop and laptop to Void from Arch. I had used Void before but switched away from it because there were some packages I use missing from their repositories. That point hasn&rsquo;t really changed much, but I thought I&rsquo;d give it another go anyway.
Note: There&rsquo;s a guide on the Void Linux docs page about an installation with encrypted boot, I personally choose to leave my boot partition unencrypted because I think it&rsquo;s largely useless to do it; and also because the Grub bootloader doesn&rsquo;t support luks2 scheme so you&rsquo;re forced to use luks1 which I&rsquo;m uncomfortable with.</p>

<p class="desc">About efym.net moderation.
I had a somewhat long ramble here publicly explaining some of my views on various things but I have decided to replace it with this short notice. Not because my views and opinions have changed (they haven&rsquo;t) but because I want to keep efym.net about Free Software and Linux administration.
I do not want to participate in the many discussions taking place around the technology world which aren&rsquo;t to do with the subject of technology itself because frankly, I don&rsquo;t care.</p>

<p class="desc">A few thoughts on why social media is a cancerous institution.
Every single person on the face of the earth thinks they&rsquo;re special, different from the rest and that their motives are so intricate and complex nobody could possibly decipher them.
Modern data-aggregation empirically throws these unfounded thoughts right out of the window.
Many years ago there was a &ldquo;viral&rdquo; story around the internet which depicted a man furiously wanting to sue Target (the US supermarket chain) for sending his daughter coupons for pregnancy paraphernalia; such as baby clothes and cribs.</p>

Important definitions you should read and be acquainted with:
Free Software Proprietary Software Why do we use software? Or better yet, why do we use computers in general? For most people the answer to this general question would be something along the lines of &ldquo;because they help me accomplish X&rdquo; and without a nuanced analysis that&rsquo;s a fine answer.</p>

<p class="desc">The system I use to backup config files from all my boxes.
When you&rsquo;re like me and try to self-host as many of the services you use as humanly possible, having a reliable backup system is imperative. I have already lost my configs more times than I&rsquo;d care to admit so I wrote a couple scripts to automate the process.
I run a server in my house which acts as a NAS and a central location to automate various things including backups.</p>

<h3><a href="/blog/hosting-infrastructure/">Hosting Infrastructure</a></h3>
<p class="desc">Trying to move into a server that gives better control over VPS boxes while retaining the privacy given by no-account, no signup and crypto payed deployments.
August 31, 2020
Update: All of my services have succesfully been migrated to 1984hosting's infrastructure in Iceland, no issues of significance were had and the only downtime experienced was the expected time it takes for DNS records to update and propagate throughout the internet. After a couple days of fairly heavy usage I'm quite content with performance for the tests I have performed, I'd still like to test the I/O a little further with heavier databases but I don't think it'll be much of a problem.</p>
