## Intro

I'm **tw1zr**, a dedicated **GNU/Linux** sysadmin, DevOps Engineer and free software advocate. My real name is George, well met.

I navigate the inner depths of servers from the ominous black boxes known as terminal emulators.

## Software and Workflow

I _exclusively_ use **GNU/Linux** on every device. My desktop and laptop run [Arch Linux](https://archlinux.org) while my servers are powered by [Debian](https://debian.org), usually inside a [Proxmox](https://proxmox.com) hypervisor.

A staunch **neovim** enthusiast, I customise 99% of my computer interactions with **vim**-like keybindings and rely heavily on the command line for most tasks.

Here's my essential toolkit:

- **Window Manager:** [awesomeWM](https://github.com/awesomeWM/awesome)
- **Application Launcher:** [rofi](https://github.com/davatorium/rofi)
- **Terminal Emulator:** [alacritty](https://github.com/alacritty/alacritty)
- **Text Editor:** [neovim](https://github.com/neovim/neovim)
- **File Manager:** [yazi](https://github.com/sxyazi/yazi)
- **Music Player:** [mpd](https://github.com/MusicPlayerDaemon/MPD) + [ncmpcpp](https://github.com/ncmpcpp/ncmpcpp)
- **Video Player:** [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv)
- **Image Viewer:** [nsxiv](https://codeberg.org/nsxiv/nsxiv)
- **Password Manager:** [password-store](https://git.zx2c4.com/password-store)
- **Web Browsers:** [qutebrowser](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser), [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-GB/firefox) & [LibreWolf](https://librewolf.net)

These are my primary tools, though my toolkit is always expanding.

I prefer the command line for its efficiency and precision—unlike my younger self who was dazzled by the flashy, fast-paced visuals of computers. However, for tasks that demand graphical interfaces, like photo or video editing, I opt for tools like [GIMP](https://gimp.org), [OpenShot](https://openshot.org), [ImageMagick](https://imagemagick.org), and [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org).
