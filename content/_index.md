This website serves as my personal [blog](/posts) as well as an entry point to the [services](/services) I host in an effort to help keep the internet a decentralized place instead of having people only visit the same 3 websites everyday.

You can't escape from your mind, but you can certainly escape from modern digital tyranny. I'm here to help.

Everything hosted here is free software, but the hosting still costs money. [Cryptocurrency contributions](/support) are appreciated.
