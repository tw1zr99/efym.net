This website serves as my personal [blog](/posts) as well as an entry point to the [services](/services) I host in an effort to help keep the internet a decentralised place instead of everyone only visiting the same three websites everyday.

You can't escape from your mind, but you can certainly escape from modern digital tyranny; it just requires some effort.

Everything hosted here is free software, but the hosting still costs money. [Cryptocurrency contributions](/support) are appreciated.
