**Happily employed**

I currently work as a DevOps Engineer for a software company in Brighton, UK.

<!--Contact me for a CV and references, or a phone call. I'll dazzle you.-->

Anything sensitive or containing personal information that needs to be sent through e-mail must be PGP encrypted using the above key.
From a GNU/Linux box you can import the PGP key into your keyring thusly:
```
curl -L efym.net/public.asc | gpg --import
```
It may or may not also work on macOS—don't know, don't care—even less so about Windows so do your own research for those. Or better yet, stop using them.
Do keep in mind that I won't hesitate to delete and block e-mails pertaining sensitive and/or personal information which haven't been encrypted.

<!--If I know you in real life the best way to contact me on a regular basis is through Matrix. My personal homeserver **efym.net** is not currently accepting registrations, but you can still contact me from other homeservers since federation is enabled.-->

I am not in any social media sites whatsoever so don't bother looking for me in any of those. Instead, take some time to read this: [Digital Diseases](/posts/digital-diseases) and this: [Why I self-host everything I can](/posts/why-i-self-host).
