## Infrastructure twist

For every post before this one we've been deploying the containers into our VMs with **Ansible**, I have explained the interactions between every VM in detail.

In this post I'll be showing the deployment with **docker-compose** in my own personal infrastructure to monitor various things in one of my VPS boxes as well as the server in my house.

## The goal

![](/blog/sysadmin-playground/15.png)

As you can see in the picture, that is a **Grafana** dashboard which shows CPU, RAM and disk usage on 2 boxes (**snazzy** and **vera**).

To achieve this we'll be using a software stack comprised of **Prometheus**, **node-exporter** and the aforementioned **Grafana**.  
**Prometheus** and **Grafana** are run in my homeserver, while **node-exporter** runs both in my homeserver and the VPS box.

## Preparation
Let's install the packages we will need with this command:

```
$ apt install docker-ce container.io docker-compose
```

Also to make sure the **Docker** service is enabled and started we'll run this command:

```
$ systemctl enable --now docker.service
```

> **Note:** I run **Taefik** as my edge router and reverse-proxy, this will become apparent in the next section when we start writing **docker-compose** files.  
> Deploying a reverse-proxy is out of the scope of this post so I'll just assume the reader has one working. It doesn't have to be **Traefik**; it could be **nginx**, **Apache**, **Caddy** or any other.

## node-exporter

Let's create a directory where we'll store the files necessary for the stack, I like to keep my **Docker**-related files in `/srv` so I'll create a directory called `metrics` there. This is done in both boxes we'll be working with.

```
mkdir -p /srv/metrics && cd /srv/metrics
```

I'll first deal with the VPS since it only needs **node-exporter**, then expand the compose file for the server which will host **Prometheus** and **Grafana**.

Create a file called `docker-compose.yml` in this directory with the following content:

**`root@vera:~ $ cat /srv/metrics/docker-compose.yml`**
```
version: "3.7"
services:

  node-exporter:
    container_name: "node-exporter"
    hostname: "node-exporter"
    image: "quay.io/prometheus/node-exporter:latest"
    restart: "unless-stopped"
    volumes:
      - "/etc/localtime:/etc/localtime:ro"
      - '/:/host:ro,rslave'
    command:
      - '--path.rootfs=/host'
    pid: "host"
    privileged: "true"
    healthcheck:
      test: "wget --no-verbose --tries=1 --spider 127.0.0.1:9100"
      interval: "1m30s"
      timeout: "10s"
      retries: "3"
    labels:
      - "traefik.enable=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.nodeexporter.tls=true"
      - "traefik.http.routers.nodeexporter.entrypoints=websecure"
      - "traefik.http.routers.nodeexporter.rule=Host(`nodeexporter.efym.net`)"
      - "traefik.http.services.nodeexporter.loadbalancer.server.port=9100"
      - "traefik.http.routers.nodeexporter.middlewares=metrics-auth@file"
    networks:
      - "rawr"
    dns:
      - "10.3.0.100"

networks:
  rawr:
    name: "rawr"
    ipam:
      driver: "default"
      config:
        - subnet: "10.3.0.0/24"
```

Now from the same directory we run:

```
root@vera:~ $ docker-compose up -d
```

After the **Docker** image is pulled from its repository the container will start in a couple of seconds.  
This compose file mounts the root directory of our server (`/`) inside the container's path we defined, in this case `/host`.  
This allows the container to monitor the host box's aspects we want to display on our **Grafana** dashboard. It is also mounted as read-only, so the container cannot actually make any changes the our host's filesystem.
