I had a somewhat long ramble here publicly explaining some of my views on various things but I have decided to replace it with this short notice. Not because my views and opinions have changed (they haven't) but because I want to keep **efym.net** about Free Software, **Linux** administration and DevOps topics.
I do not want to participate in the many discussions taking place around the technology world which aren't to do with the subject of technology itself because frankly, I don't care.

So if you're interested in what kind of moderation I do on my **Matrix** homeserver and whatever other services I may offer here's the list of my criteria:

* Absolutely **zero** child pornography of any kind.

That's it. Everything else is okay.
