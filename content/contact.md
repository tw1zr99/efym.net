| ‚úâÔ∏è  e-mail  | [tw1zr@efym.net](mailto:tw1zr@efym.net)                |
| üîê PGP key | [tw1zr-pub.asc](/tw1zr-pub.asc)                        |

Anything sensitive or containing personal information that needs to be sent through e-mail must be PGP encrypted using the above key.  
From a GNU/Linux box you can import the PGP key into your keyring thusly:
```
curl -L efym.net/tw1zr-pub.asc | gpg --import
```
It may or may not also work on macOS‚Äîdon't know, don't care‚Äîeven less so about Windows so do your own research for those. Or better yet, stop using them.  
Do keep in mind that I won't hesitate to delete and block e-mails pertaining sensitive and/or personal information which haven't been encrypted.

If I know you in real life the best way to contact me on a regular basis is through Matrix. You may go to and make an account at the homerserver I host using [my element-web instance](https://chat.efym.net) or use any Matrix client and point it to **efym.net** to create an account; then add me using the ID above.

I am not in any social media sites whatsoever so don't bother looking for me in any of those. Instead, take some time to read this: [Digital Diseases](/blog/digital-diseases) and this: [Why I self-host everything I can](/blog/why-i-self-host).
